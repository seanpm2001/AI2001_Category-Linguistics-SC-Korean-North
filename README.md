# [AI2001](https://github.com/seanpm2001/AI2001/) data sets

## Category: Linguistics

### Subcategory (SC): Korean (North)

This dataset is under development/coming soon.

> **Note** North Korean is a variant of the Korean language. Due to the Korean War and the subsequent Korean Conflict (ongoing since 1950, June 25th, and still going, as of 2023, Thursday, April 6th) North Korean is a distinct dialect of the Korean language, and should not be confused with [:octocat: the South Korean language](https://github.com/seanpm2001/AI2001_Category-Linguistics-SC-Korean-South/).

**Development note:** I originally split this off from South Korean, and put it on my schedule for July, but due to a recent duplicate entry set, it was moved to 2023, Thursday, April 6th.

**üå±Ô∏è This [`README.md`](/README.md) file is a major stub and need significant expansion**
